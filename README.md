# Portfolio Website

My portfolio project is where I put all of my projects on
one page, along with my skills and a closer look of my journey.

## Features

- Interactive Navigation: Users can seamlessly navigate through different sections of the portfolio, exploring my projects and learning more about my creative journey.
- Dynamic and Responsive: Built with Nextjs, the portfolio is responsive and adapts gracefully to different devices, ensuring a consistent and engaging experience for all users.

## Technologies Used

- Nextjs
- Next/Font
- Tailwind

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
